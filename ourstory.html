            <p class="details">
              I set my eyes on this special lady on the 18th of March, 2014, I greeted her, "good morning," she replied, "good morning," with a nice voice and innocent mind. I liked the way she replied to me and I started greeting her every morning wherever I saw her.<br>
              I did a little monitoring, just to know her from a distance before getting closer. She talked less in class and mostly talked with her friend.
              I made enquiries about her from our classmates who knew her.
              They told me she was not in a relationship, I was excited, even though it took months before I approached her, she was too quiet for me (from a distance).<br>
              On this fateful day (August 11), I saw and walked up to her and whispered into her ears, "I wanna know more about you..." I didn't wait for the response, I left. I went home imagining her response.<br>
              3 days later, she saw my friends and I, and she slid a paper into my hands which I didn't open until I got home. <br>
              She wrote:<br>
              "My name is Olamide.<br>
              My phone number is 0806****, I know you will ask.<br>
              I'm complex, you can't know me at once."<br>
              I called her immediately.
              We talked and realised we had a lot in common. There and then, our love grew more than I thought.<br>
              We went through a lot together, while in school, during NYSC and thereafter.<br>
              Alhamdulillah for the relationship so far.<br>
              I also thank Allah for allowing our paths to cross, Olami.<br>
              I love you endlessly üòç.
            </p>

            <p class="details">
              I heard a whisper, "I want to know all about you..."<br>
Then I turned back, shocked, because I was a gentle and easygoing individual and I didn't have many friends in school.
I saw him all smiling as he walked away not waiting for a reply from me.<br>

So, we met in school in 2014, and he was always greeting me, "good morning" anytime he walked past me and  nothing more.<br>

I eventually replied him by writing few things about me in a piece of paper which reads, <br>
"My name is Olamide, I'm sure you know.<br> You can't know all about me. I'm very complex.<br>My number is :0806*****, I'm sure you would still ask me."<br>
After 3 days, I saw him again, I gave him the paper and walked away too.

He called me that very day and we started talking, along the line I knew he was the one.<br>
2015, he said he was going to marry me. I said, "Of course!"<br>
In 2020, he officially asked for my hand in marriage, I said, "Yes!"<br>
Now, here we are!
